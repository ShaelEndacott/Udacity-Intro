			<p>The grey wolf is a large canid. It is a predator that is at or near the top of the food chain. As its range has expanded, it has once again come into contact with humans.
				The effects of wolf-human interaction in North America have led to the deaths of many wolves and impeded its return to its former habitat.</p>
